								<h3 class="major"> SYSTEMVERILOG SELF-ATTENTION HEAD MODULE </h3>
								<code> SystemVerilog </code>
								<code> Xilinx Vivado Xsim </code>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									Built using SystemVerilog, this is a project accumulating of various submodules including softmax, acc, exp, etc., which all ensured to be fully pipelined.
									Tested rigourously using the Xilinx Vivado Xsim simulation, observing, catching and troubleshooting waveform errors, while ensuring the timing integrity of implementation.
								</p>

								<h3 class="major"> REAL-TIME TASK SCHEDULING ON STM32F401RE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h3>
								<code> Embedded C </code>
								<code> STM32Cube IDE </code>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									Developed with a team - a real-time executive (RTX) 
									on the STM32F401RE embedded system, focusing on multitasking, 
									memory management, and pre-emptive scheduling. It includes hands-on 
									experience with the STM32Cube IDE and embedded C programming, building 
									machine-level functionalities like dynamic task creation, memory allocation, 
									and scheduling using machine learning algorithms for optimization. 
									The core objective is to manage and schedule tasks efficiently on the 
									STM32 microcontroller while considering real-time constraints.
								</p>

								<hr />
								<h3 class="major"> STM32 WATER PUMP SIMULATOR </h3>
								<code> Embedded C </code>
								<code> STM32Cube IDE </code>
								<p></p>
								<p>
									Consisted of multiple parts including PWM motor, potentiometer, ultrasonic sensor, etc., 
									this project was ran upon a NUCLEO-F401RE and a custom-soldered PCB. Realizing the features 
									of a water pump simulation. Incorporated PWM-controlled motors for precise pump 
									operation, an ultrasonic sensor for accurate water level detection, and a seven-segment display 
									for real-time data visualization. Established UART in addition for communication with a PC for 
									interactive data visualization and configured JTAG pins for effective debugging and programming.
								</p>


								<hr />
								<h3 class="major"> VIRTUAL GRAPPLER PLATFORM </h3>
								<code> VHDL </code>
								<p></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Virtual_Grappler.png"></span>
								<p>
									This is a project that simulates a platform that enables moving the grappler to a certain coordinate and activate it.
									This project contains several blocks including 2 registers, 2 binary counters, and 2 Compx4's. It also supports converting 
									hexadecimal number to a 7-segment number, by including a number of 2 hex to 7-segment decoders. It also includes a reset features,
									where it is allowed to set eveerything to its normal state.
								</p>


								<hr />

								<h3 class="major"> VIRTUAL HVAC SYSTEM</h3>
								<code> VHDL </code>
								<p></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/HVAC_Unit.png"></span>
								<p>
									This is a project that simulated an HVAC unit, it allows users to set up desired and vacation temperature,
									and the system would send signals to the energy monitor block in order to change the room temperature. 
									The hexadecimal to 7-segment decodert is also included, so that the system could represent values in 
									7-segment.
